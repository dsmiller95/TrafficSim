DragDropInputElement : DragDropBase 
	no children. can only drag into DragDropInput's slot

DragDropBase 
	doesn't do much. holds framework for linking drag-drops, but does not actually link.
		EX: has awarenes of which dragabbles it is currently hovering over while being dragged
			When the drag is released, a overridable callback prevents anything from happening

DragDropSeries : DragDropBase 
	Will drop and lock onto other DragDrops in series, forming a chain of single-child single-parents

DragDropInput : DragDropSeries
	Will drop and lock just like DragDropSeries.
		will also accept drops from DragDropInputElement, taking ownership of them inside of its own element
		Will keep track of all owned DragDropInputElements
	Used for things like "SetAcceleration" when setting it to a value
	In the future:
		may allow for a text-based input in leu of a DragDropInputElement
		
ICarSensorInstance<T>

		a child of a Car's gameObject
	Returned by ICarSensable when queried
	T Sense()
	
IScriptableCarSensor<T>
	Used as a base for any scriptable sensor. This class needs to use ICarSensorInstance to actually execute a sensation
	T Sense(ICarSensable target)

ICarSensable
	ICarSensorInstance<T> GetCarSensor<T>(SensorType type)
